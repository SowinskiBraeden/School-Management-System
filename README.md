# School-Management-System
I want to create a School Management system to improve my GoLang skills to transition into an Intermediate GoLang developer.

This is a full API to allow students to check their schedule, locker information and possibly grades in the future along with personal information.
It allows for teachers to view their information and in the future manage classes, see students in a class, schedule, etc.
It allows admins to update most information and view information. Those who run the school and help create the schedules or help students update information like names, classes, etc.

Possible in the future when the API is complete I may start working on the front end to make it fully functional.
