# Testing

If you're looking in here, I know this codespace is a mess, I didn't think I would include it.  
But to be fair, I think a problem as complex as schedule generation should be seen. Currently  
the tests are being run in python since it is a lot easier for me to quickly test and edit the   
algorithm. Once I get the algorithm complete, I plan on rewriting it in GoLang, using the python  
script as a reference.

Hello again! If you're reading this part, again ingore the awful codespace, but `generateScheduleV3`  
in `tinker.py` is the best one yet. It uses real sample data from my school in 2018. This puts the  
algorithm through the realistic obstacles it may face. It uses a different approach that you can read  
about in `tinker.py` about the function. Hopefully this will get a larger success rate than the previous  
versions!
