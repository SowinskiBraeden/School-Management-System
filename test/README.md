# Testing

If you're looking in here, I know this codespace is a mess, I didn't think I would include it.  
But to be fair, I think a problem as complex as schedule generation should be seen. Currently  
the tests are being run in python since it is a lot easier for me to quickly test and edit the   
algorithm. Once I get the algorithm complete, I plan on rewriting it in GoLang, using the python  
script as a reference.
